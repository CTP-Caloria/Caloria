# Caloría
Calorie counter and recipe finder for alternatives to healthy eating.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br>
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.

### Running the app

For local development you will need two terminals open, one for the api-backend and another for the react-client.

*Clone* this app, then:

```bash
# api-backend terminal 1
cp .env.example .env
npm install
npm run dev
```

```bash
# react-client terminal 2
cd client
npm install
npm start
```

- api-backend will launch at: http://localhost:8080
- react-client will launch at: http://localhost:3000

> In production you will only deploy a single app. The react client will build into static files that will be served from the backend.

## Deployment

### Setting up Heroku

Install the Heroku CLI if you don't already have it. 

> You will also need a Heroku account
> And this will only be done once on your machine

```bash
# on mac
brew install heroku/brew/heroku
heroku login
```

### Create a Heroku project

Next, `cd` into this project directory and create a project:

```bash
heroku create cool-appname
heroku addons:create heroku-postgresql:hobby-dev
```

> This will deploy your apps to https://cool-appname.herokuapp.com, assuming that it is not taken already.

> You only need to do this once per app

### Deploying the app

Whenever you want to update the app run this command.

```bash
git push heroku master
```

> This command deploys your master branch. You can change that and deploy a different branch such as: `git push heroku development`
